In Coursera, I watched a video that is a talk.

Vishal Disawa, an android developer, makes two android apps.

There is one sentense he said, **whenever you want to learn something do a project with it.** that I think is the most important point at doing project.

In this year, I list some project I want to finish. 

No matter how difficult it is. It is a beginning. And I believe I can do it.
